"""Score trials and run full experiments.

Two entry points:

- :func:`evaluate` blocks and returns a fully-populated :class:`RunResults`.
- :func:`stream_evaluate` yields :class:`Trial` and :class:`Scoring` items
  as soon as they are ready, so callers can render progress or persist
  partial results and survive mid-run crashes.

Both share the same threaded engine. :func:`~promptuna.run.run_trial` and
:func:`score_metric` are total functions: they never raise, instead wrapping
failures into :class:`~promptuna.run.FailedTrial` / :class:`FailedScoring` so the
executor loop stays simple.
